    "\n",
    "    Industry Competition: Intel and AMD are fierce competitors in the CPU and GPU markets. Intel was the dominant player for decades, but AMD has seen a resurgence in recent years with its Ryzen and EPYC processors, which have gained popularity in both consumer and enterprise segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Technology Cycles: Both companiesâ€™ stocks are influenced by the release of new processor architectures, changes in manufacturing technology, and shifts in demand for computing power. Analyzing them gives insights into how the market reacts to innovation, production challenges, and market share changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Market Dynamics: Recently, AMD has gained momentum due to a more aggressive roadmap, while Intel has faced challenges in advancing its manufacturing processes. This competition drives volatility and trends, making them perfect candidates for predictive modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yahoo Finance (via yfinance Python package)(Thanks to ChatGTP)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Advantages: Yahoo Finance offers a straightforward API via the yfinance library, which makes it easy to download extensive historical data.\n",
    "    Steps:\n",
    "        Use yfinance to download daily, weekly, or monthly stock prices (open, close, high, low, volume) for both Intel and AMD.\n",
    "        Specify the time range you need, which can go as far back as the early 1980s."
